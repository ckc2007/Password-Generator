# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

```
I have created a password generator that takes user input for selected criteria, and returns a randomized password that meets those criteria. 

User will input the desired length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters),
Uswer will select at least one character type (upper Case, lower Case, numeric, special characters)
The password generator will disply the password in the webpage.
```

## User Story

```
AS A client that wants to generate a strong randomized user password
I WANT to select the length, and character types to include in this password
SO THAT when i click on the generate password button, a unique and randomized password that meets all my input criteria is produced as a string value.
